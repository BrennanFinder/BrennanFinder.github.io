    <h1>Fake eclipse glasses are hitting the market. Here's how to tell if you have a pair</h1>

    <h2>As the total solar eclipse, occurring across Mexico, the United States and Canada on April 8, draws near, experts are reminding spectators to grab a pair of eclipse glasses to view the celestial event safely — and to make sure they aren't fake.</h2>

<p>Counterfeit eclipse glasses are “polluting the marketplace,” according to <a href="https://aas.org/press/american-astronomical-society-warns-counterfeit-fake-eclipse-glasses">a release shared by the American Astronomical Society</a>, or AAS.</p>

<p>A total solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, completely blocking the sun's face from view for a few moments. About 32 million people in the US live within the 115-mile-wide (185-kilometer-wide) path of totality, or locations where the moon will appear to completely cover the sun and the lunar shadow falls on the Earth's surface. People outside the path of totality will still be able to see a partial solar eclipse in which the moon only blocks part of the sun's face.</p>

<p>The only time it's safe to view the sun without eye protection is during the totality of a total solar eclipse, or the brief period when the moon completely blocks the light of the sun, according to NASA.</p>

<p>The lenses of solar eclipse glasses are made of black polymer, or resin infused with carbon particles, that blocks nearly all visible, infrared and ultraviolet light, according to <a href="https://www.planetary.org/articles/are-your-solar-eclipse-glasses-safe">The Planetary Society</a>. And sunglasses won't work in place of eclipse glasses or solar viewers.</p>

<p>Looking at the sun without properly made eclipse glasses can result in severe eye injury, from temporary vision impairment to permanent blindness. But the AAS has discovered the production of fraudulent eclipse glasses that won't provide the necessary protection needed to view the sun safely without incurring eye damage.</p>

<h3>How to spot fake eclipse glasses</h3>

<p>The counterfeit glasses might be hard to spot because they include information and even original artwork that suggest they were made by a known reputable manufacturer of the products, but different factories that have yet to be identified actually made them, according to the AAS.</p>

<p>“Until recently, the only counterfeit products we knew of were cardboard-frame eclipse glasses made by an unidentified factory in China but printed with 'Mfg. by: American Paper Optics' (APO) on them,” the AAS shared in a news release. “APO is one of the major U.S. manufacturers of safe solar viewers and prints its name and address on its eclipse glasses, whereas the Chinese copycat products have APO's name but not its address. Thankfully, these particular counterfeits appear to be safe.”</p>

<p>But close tracking by the AAS has revealed that more unidentified factories are producing counterfeit glasses printed with the name and address of a Chinese factory called Cangnan County Qiwei Craft Co., which creates safe products. Some of the fake glasses also include the name or logo of Solar Eclipse International, Canada, which is Qiwei's North American distributor.</p>

<p> While some of the glasses appear to be safe and are virtually indistinguishable from actual Qiwei products, others have lenses about as dark as sunglasses, which means they aren't safe to use, according to the AAS.</p>

<p> “Filters that provide safe, comfortable views of the Sun generally transmit between 1 part in 100,000 (0.001%) and 1 part in 2,000,000 (0.00005%) of its visible light,” said Rick Fienberg, project manager of the AAS Solar Eclipse Task Force, in a statement. “Solar filters are at least 1,000 times darker than even the darkest regular sunglasses.”</p>
  
  <p>The AAS has curated a list of safe manufacturers and resellers of eclipse glasses and filters for optical devices, including cameras and smartphones. The AAS task force for the eclipse has confirmed that solar viewers and glasses made by all known manufacturers of the products in the US and across Europe, as well as some Chinese manufacturers, have been tested in a lab.</p>

  <p>“We now recommend that if you want to buy solar viewers online, buy only from sites you reach by clicking on the links from our list, or from a seller whose identity you can verify and whose name appears on our list,” according to the AAS. “We recommend not buying eclipse glasses from random sellers in online marketplaces, even if they claim to get their products from a supplier on our list or to be approved by the AAS or NASA. The U.S. space agency doesn't approve or endorse commercial products, so any claim to the contrary is a warning sign that you're not dealing with a trustworthy seller. Similarly, if a vendor claims to be on the AAS suppliers list but you can't find it there, you shouldn't trust them.”</p>
