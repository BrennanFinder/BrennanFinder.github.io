  <h1>Fake eclipse glasses are hitting the market. Here's how to tell if you have a pair</h1>

  <h2>As the total solar eclipse, occurring across Mexico, the United States and Canada on April 8, draws near, experts are reminding spectators to grab a pair of eclipse glasses to view the celestial event safely — and to make sure they aren't fake.</h2>

<p>Counterfeit eclipse glasses are “polluting the marketplace,” according to <a href="https://aas.org/press/american-astronomical-society-warns-counterfeit-fake-eclipse-glasses">a release shared by the American Astronomical Society</a>, or AAS.</p>

<p>A total solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, completely blocking the sun's face from view for a few moments. About 32 million people in the US live within the 115-mile-wide (185-kilometer-wide) path of totality, or locations where the moon will appear to completely cover the sun and the lunar shadow falls on the Earth's surface. People outside the path of totality will still be able to see a partial solar eclipse in which the moon only blocks part of the sun's face.</p>

<p>The only time it's safe to view the sun without eye protection is during the totality of a total solar eclipse, or the brief period when the moon completely blocks the light of the sun, according to NASA.</p>

<p>The lenses of solar eclipse glasses are made of black polymer, or resin infused with carbon particles, that blocks nearly all visible, infrared and ultraviolet light, according to <a href="https://www.planetary.org/articles/are-your-solar-eclipse-glasses-safe">The Planetary Society</a>. And sunglasses won't work in place of eclipse glasses or solar viewers.</p>

<p>Looking at the sun without properly made eclipse glasses can result in severe eye injury, from temporary vision impairment to permanent blindness. But the AAS has discovered the production of fraudulent eclipse glasses that won't provide the necessary protection needed to view the sun safely without incurring eye damage.</p>

<h3>How to spot fake eclipse glasses</h3>

<p>The counterfeit glasses might be hard to spot because they include information and even original artwork that suggest they were made by a known reputable manufacturer of the products, but different factories that have yet to be identified actually made them, according to the AAS.</p>
